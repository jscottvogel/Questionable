# react-triple-toggle-switch
This is a simple three state toggle switch built with/for react projects.

##Motivation
I couldn't find a three stage toggle switch that was ready made and suited my needs, so I created one and figured that others might need one as well.

##Example 


    import React from 'react';
    import TripleToggleSwitch from 'react-triple- 
    toggle-switch';

    const Example = (props) => {
      const labels = {
        left: {
          title: 'left',
          value: 'left'
        },
        right: {
          title: 'right',
          value: 'right'
        },
        center: {
          title: 'center',
          value: 'center'
        },
      }

      const onChange = (value) => 
        console.log('value',value)

      return (
        <div>
          <TripleToggleSwitch
            labels={labels}
            onChange={onChange}
          />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default Example


##Installation
###NPM
``npm install react-triple-toggle-switch``

##More to come
This is very much a work in progress. I am in the process of adding the ability to adjust sizing and styling of the component out of the box. I also have plans to add the use of symbols as well as a loading/spinner state for the switch. Any other ideas or contributions are welcome!
